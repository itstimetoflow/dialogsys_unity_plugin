I could sense it! It's brightful and vibrant..;;;;
You look thoghtfull.. Are you really enjoying your time here?;;;;
Kinda.. The city is really beautifull, but I need meet new people..;;;;
Ow, I see.. I could help... We should go out sometime.. Hey.. there's someone that maybe you could meet..;;;;
Her name is Greta. She is really fun and has a colorfull personality. Beside, she is really beautiful.. and best of all: she is single!;;;;
??;;;;
Don't get me wrong.. It's been a while she has been lonely. She has met a bunch of suckers lately.. and you seem like a good guy;;;;
I'm good at reading people..;;;;
You don't know me, but I thank your judgement about my personality. I think it is a little bit odd, but it does no harm to try meet her.;;;;
I've been single for a while, so maybe I'll give a shot. What does she look like?;;;;
Oh, she is really pretty! She is a horse with a blue coat and a long mane..;;;;
First talk Nestor just finished;;;;
Have you?;;;;
Talking about Greta again;;;;
Hey, have you talked to Greta?;;;;
Hi man! how's it going?;;;;
Not so good. I do talk with that girl Greta, as you ask me. But it didin't work well...;;;;
She didn't like you?;;;;
She got defensive when I accidentally insinuate that someone told me that she could meet someone;;;;
Oh god..;;;;
Yes, she had assumed that it was you and dismiss me right away..;;;;
She told me that other people have approach her after talking to you. Is that true?;;;;
Oh man, I'm just trying to help her!;;;;
It was just embarrassing...;;;;
Don't bother about it man.. So tell me.. did you like her?;;;;
She is really pretty, despite being a little grumpy.;;;;
Dont bother! She is a great girl. Go for it! ;;;;
I'll see what I can do...;;;;
There's something you can do to impress her. There's a japanese flower that she is looking for a long time.;;;;
I think the name is something like 'Radiada'. It's a beautiful flower that looks like a magnificent dove.;;;;
Mr. ;;;;
a merchant that has just arrived from his usual trips, must have bring one that I had ordered.;;;;
But do you gonna give it to me so I could present Greta with it?;;;;
Exactly! You just have to pay the order invoice. With it, you gonna strike her heart big time!;;;;
Ok, I'm gonna find this guy and get it. Wish me luck!;;;;
Good luck, my man!;;;;
