==============================================================================================


Glossary 
Core: software libraries (dialogsys.dll or similar, etc) that hold main functions to operate the dialog code that are produced by the DialogSys stand alone application. 

Content

The content of the Core libraries are protected and proprietary and cannot be modified, reverse engineered, distributed, selled, reselled or whatever other action that harms Flow Software ownership.

The open code that composes a DialogSys plugin (for Unity or any other engine or platform) can be modified to suit the user’s development needs, but it can’t be selled, reselled or any other commercial action outside its final build game or application. It can't be commercialized alone without consent of the Flow Software. 

The open code that composes a DialogSys plugin can be adapted for other engines (Unreal, MonoGame, GameMaker etc) and freely distributed (non commercial), always crediting Flow Software for its original source. 

Flow Software can’t take responsibility for any modified versions of DialogSys plugin code that may harm in any way end users. 

Flow Software may not give full user support for free or open versions of its code or software.

Flow Software could update its software or source code at any time without previous announcement.
