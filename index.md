The new app to produce game dialogs.

[**{{ app.name }}**](https://github.com/itstimetoflow/dialogsystem) is a new tool that will help you build dialogues for your games in a more practical and fluid way.
Using the power of web technologies, such as html, css and javascript, we built an agile and intuitive interface, all for you to focus on what else is needed: working in your game dialogs.


##Try it yourself now!
**{{ app.name }}** is in its early alphas, so take a look and start enjoying its advantages!

##Which engine can I use this? 
For now, DialogSys is only available for Unity (tested on version {{ app.unity_version }}). We have plans to implement it to other platforms as well.
